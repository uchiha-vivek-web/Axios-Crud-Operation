# CRUD Operations with Axios and MockAPI

This project demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using React, Axios, and MockAPI. It is a simple example designed to help developers understand and implement these operations in a React-based application.

## Overview

CRUD operations are fundamental for any application that interacts with a database or external API. This project showcases how to build a React application with the following features:

1. **Create**: Add new data to the MockAPI backend.
2. **Read**: Fetch and display data from MockAPI.
3. **Update**: Modify existing data in MockAPI.
4. **Delete**: Remove data from MockAPI.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Front-end library for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests.
- **MockAPI**: A free online API platform for testing and prototyping APIs.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the UI components.

## Features

### 1. **Create Operation**
- A form is provided to add a new record (e.g., name and email).
- Data is submitted to the MockAPI endpoint via a `POST` request.

### 2. **Read Operation**
- Displays data fetched from MockAPI in a table format.
- Data is retrieved using a `GET` request.

### 3. **Update Operation**
- Allows editing of existing records.
- Data is updated on MockAPI via a `PUT` request.

### 4. **Delete Operation**
- Enables deletion of records from MockAPI.
- Data is removed using a `DELETE` request.
